        In JavaScript, the concept of "scope" refers to the accessibility of variables and functions in various parts of your code. Scopes are crucial for understanding variable visibility and lifecycle.<br /> JavaScript has several types of scopes: Global
        Scope Function Scope Block Scope Let 's look at each one with examples.
        <ol>1. Global scope : Variables declared outside any function or the block have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the code.</ol>
        <ol>2. Function scope : Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. This is known as function scope.</ol>
        <ol>3. Block scope : Introduced with ES6, block scope allows you to restrict variable visibility to the block in which they are defined. This is achieved with let and const.</ol>
